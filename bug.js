While developing an Expo managed workflow application, I encountered a peculiar issue where the application would crash intermittently without providing any clear error messages in the console.  The crash occurred seemingly at random, making debugging difficult.  I've isolated the issue to a specific section of code involving asynchronous operations and state management with Expo's `useEffect` hook and asynchronous storage.  The application uses React Native's `AsyncStorage` to persist data, and the crashes seemed correlated with read/write operations.  I've tried various debugging techniques, including logging, error boundaries, and using the Expo Go debugger, but I haven't been able to pinpoint the root cause of the crashes.
